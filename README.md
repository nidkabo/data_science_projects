# Data Science Projects
I used the skills learned from [DataRockie School](https://bootcamp.datarockie.com/) to create these projects. The projects are split into 10 skill topics as follows:

## Spreadsheets
  - [x] [Dynamic Query](Spreadsheets/dynamic_query.png) -  Queries that are built dynamically to give a desired result.
  - [x] [Convert TH to EN Date](Spreadsheets/convert_date.png) - Converting dates from Thai date (the Buddhist Era) to English date (the Common Era).
  - [x] [ID Card Parser](Spreadsheets/regex.png) - Using regular expression to parse ID card information into objects that you can work with.
## SQL
  - [x] [Coffee Shop Database](https://replit.com/@NidkamolBoonyan/SQLProjects#coffee_shop/) - A small database of the coffee shop containing five tables with ER Diagram and some examples of using SELECT, WHERE, and JOIN to look for insights from the data.
  - [x] [Subqueries](https://replit.com/@NidkamolBoonyan/SQLProjects#subqueries/) - SQL Coding to answer two questions with two subqueries using "chinook.db" as a database.
## R Programming
  - [x] [Login Function](R/login_function.r) - Login application with a username and password that a user can try three times login attempts.
  - [x] [Rock Paper Scissors](R/rock_paper_scissors.r) - An interactive game names Rock, Paper, Scissors (also known as Rochambeau, Roshambo, or Janken) play with a computer using R.
## Data Transformation
  - [x] [dplyr mtcars Code](R/dplyr_mtcars.r) - Using the `dplyr` package to manipulate the `mtcars` data set and some JOIN examples.
  - [x] [dplyr diamonds Code](R/dplyr_diamonds.r) - Dealing with the `diamonds` data set in the `tidyverse` package to get the top ten largest amounts of diamonds data.
  - [x] [dplyr msleep Code](R/dplyr_msleep.r) - Another example of `dplyr` dealing with the `msleep` data set that includes basic methods of replacing NA or missing values.
  - [x] [dplyr join and date Code](R/dplyr_code.r) - Working with date in R using the `lubricate` package and some JOIN examples.
  - [x] [Analyzing NYC Flights 2013 Data](R/analyzing_nycflights13.ipynb) - Analyzing the `nycflights13` data set using the `dplyr` package in R.
  - [x] [RPostgreSQL](R/RPostgreSQL.ipynb) - Using the `RPostgreSQL` package in R to connect to the `PostgreSQL` database server hosted by [ElephantSQL](R/screenshot_details_ElephantSQL.png).
## Data Visualization
  - [ ] [Visualizing NYC Flights 2013 Data](R/viz_nycflight13.pdf) - Using the `ggplot2` package in R to create five charts to visualize the data from the `nycflight13` data set.
<!---## Statistics
  - [x] [Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb](R/Titanic_Logistic_Regression.ipynb) - Using the `titanic_train` dataset to predict the survival of Titanic passengers by logistic regression and the `stats` package in R.
  - [x] [A/B Testing with Cookie Cats](Stats/chi_squared_cookie_cats.png) - Using a chi-squared test to analyze the impact on player retention of the `Cookie Cats` mobile game in MS Excel.
## Machine Learning
  - [ ] [2-3 models using `caret`] --->
## Python Programming
  - [x] [Rock Paper Scissors](Python/rock_paper_scissors.ipynb) - An interactive game names Rock, Paper, Scissors play with a computer using Python.
  - [x] [ATM class](Python/atm_class.ipynb) - ATM class using Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concept containing five methods as functions to interact with a user.
## Essential Python for Data Analyst
  - [x] [Analyzing Sales Data](Python/analyzing_sales_data.ipynb) - Using `Pandas` and `NumPy` libraries to analyze the sales data step by step and provide interesting graphs to answer user questions.
  - [x] [API](Python/api.ipynb) - Using Game of Thrones Character API to create the Pandas DataFrame.
## Dashboard
  - [x] [Freefire vs. PubG](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JOeTRu1k1t10kQsc9QElX6sZ3smaWZKsgN8ACZn-xw8/edit?usp=sharing) - Dashboard answering user requests with Google Sheets.
