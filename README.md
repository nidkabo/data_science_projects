# Data Science Projects
I used the skills learned from [DataRockie School](https://bootcamp.datarockie.com/) to create these projects. The projects are split into 10 skill topics as follows:

## Spreadsheets
  - [x] [Dynamic Query](Spreadsheets/dynamic_query.png) -  Queries that are built dynamically to give a desired result.
  - [x] [Convert TH to EN Date](Spreadsheets/convert_date.png) - Converting dates from Thai date (the Buddhist Era) to English date (the Common Era).
  - [x] [ID Card Parser](Spreadsheets/regex.png) - Using regular expression to parse ID card information into objects that you can work with.
## SQL
  - [x] [Coffee Shop Database](https://replit.com/@NidkamolBoonyan/SQLProjects#coffee_shop/) - A small database of the coffee shop containing five tables (PK/FK) with ER Diagram and some examples of using SELECT, WHERE, and JOIN to look for insights from the data.
  - [x] [Subqueries](https://replit.com/@NidkamolBoonyan/SQLProjects#subqueries/) - Coding SQL to answer two questions with two subqueries using "chinook.db" as a database.
## R Programming
  - [x] [pizza_shop_chatbot.r](R/pizza_shop_chatbot.r) - A rule-based chatbot to order pizza with some dialogue
  - [x] [Pao_Ying_Chub.r](R/Pao_Ying_Chub.r) - An interactive rock-paper-scissors game with a bot
## Data Transformation
  - [x] [NYC_Flights_2013_Analysis.ipynb](R/NYC_Flights_2013_Analysis-Data_Transformation.ipynb) - Analyzing the `nycflights13` dataset using the `dplyr` package in `R`
  - [x] [RPostgreSQL.ipynb](R/HW_RPostgreSQL.ipynb) - Using the `RPostgreSQL` package in `R` to connect to the `PostgreSQL` database server hosted by [ElephantSQL](R/ElephantSQL-RPostgreSQL.png)
## Data Visualization
  - [x] [small_chinook_dataviz.pdf](R/hw_dataviz.pdf) - Creating 5 charts to visualize the data queried from the `Chinook` database using the `ggplot2` package in `R`
## Statistics
  - [x] [Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb](R/Titanic_Logistic_Regression.ipynb) - Using the `titanic_train` dataset to predict the survival of Titanic passengers by logistic regression and the `stats` package in `R`
  - [ ] [linear regression in Excel/Google Sheets]
  - [x] [A/B Testing with Cookie Cats](Stats/chi_squared_cookie_cats.png) - Using a chi-squared test to analyze the impact on player retention of the `Cookie Cats` mobile game in MS Excel
## Intro to Machine Learning
  - [ ] [2-3 models using `caret`] 
## Python Programming
  - [x] [Pao_Ying_Chub.ipynb](Python/HW_Intro_to_Python_programming_Pao_Ying_Chub.ipynb) - An interactive rock-paper-scissors game using `Python`
  - [x] [ATM_OOP.ipynb](Python/HW_Intro_to_Python_programming_ATM.ipynb) - An ATM class `(Object-Oriented Programming)` containing at least 5 methods as ATM functions to interact with users.
## Essential Python for Data Analyst
  - [x] [Analyzing_Sales_Data.ipynb](Python/Course_Pandas_Foundation-Final_Project.ipynb) - Using the `pandas` library to analyze sales data
  - [x] [Public_API.ipynb](Python/Public_API.ipynb) - Using Yu-Gi-Oh! Public API to create a data frame of selected cards
  - [x] [Simple_ML_models_using_sklearn.ipynb](Python/Simple_ML_models_using_sklearn.ipynb) - Using the `sklearn` library to build simple machine learning models for regression and classification problems
## Dashboard
  - [x] [Police Killings](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/25125199-b956-4fec-a808-838acc9f5e1a) - Dashboard showing the data from [Where Police Have Killed Americans In 2015, FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-police-have-killed-americans-in-2015/) - `Looker Studio`
  - [x] [Global Video Games Sales](https://public.tableau.com/views/GlobalVideoGamesSales_16717573111280/GlobalVideoGamesSales?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) - Dashboard showing the global video games sales from 1983 to 2012 - `Tableau Public`
